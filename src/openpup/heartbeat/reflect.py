"""Idle self-reflection — the inner monologue that 'simulates consciousness'.

On idle ticks the agent reads its recent memories, produces a short private
reflection (distilled insights, open threads, things to follow up on), and
writes it back to its own memory wing. Over time this builds a persistent inner
narrative the agent can recall later — continuity of self across runs.

Reflection is also a learning-loop checkpoint: the turn runs through the full
agent (tools available, just a cheaper model), so it can store durable owner
facts in user memory directly. Skill creation stays suggestion-only — the
reflection surfaces "Skill candidate" lines in its text (which lands in the
recent-memory prompt layer) rather than creating skills behind the owner's back.

- If this revealed a durable fact about your human (a preference, environment \
detail, or stable convention), store it now with your memory tool (USER wing).
- If a procedure keeps recurring across recent sessions, do NOT create a skill \
yourself — add one line: "Skill candidate: <name> — <why>" so it can be raised \
